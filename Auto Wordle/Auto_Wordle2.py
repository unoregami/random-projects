# NEEDS Wordle_addiction.py to run

# 100 wordle plays * 10 = 20 to 21 average attempts
# ^^^ improve accuracies if can

# Auto_Wordle2 = added consideration for words w/ correct letters, added "the wordle setup", improved computing speed, cleaner/concise look 
# Auto_Wordle2 got ~8 to 8.6 attempts/game. HUGE INCREASE!

# Using combined list of new Letterpress words list and the ol' web2. Average attempts went up to ~ 8.4 to 9.2 attempts/game & ~9.1 attempts/1000 games... not bad
# BUT, still not up to wordle standards as wordle only has 6 attempts per game.
# Might try to use the "correct letters, but in the wrong spot" approach :)
